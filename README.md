# Frame-Duplication-Forgery-Detection-and-Localization-Algorithm-Based-on-the-Improved-Levenshtein-Distance
This algorithm introduces a frame duplication forgery detection and localization approach based on the similarity analysis of the improved Levenshtein distance. The tampered video sequence is first divided into overlapping sub-sequences. Next, we calculate the similarities between these sub-sequences to detect the potentially duplicated candidates. Each sub-sequence has to calculate the similarities with the rest of the other sub-sequences. The improved Levenshtein distance is adopted and used as a measure of similarities in this algorithm. The similarities between all the sub-sequences are measured to find out the potentially duplicated frame pairs. These duplicated frame pairs are combined together into a complete duplicated sequence and hence the location of the frame duplication forgeries is located.
